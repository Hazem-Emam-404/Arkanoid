🎮 Arknoid Game in Assembly
This is a classic Arknoid (or Breakout-style) game implemented in Assembly language. It’s a minimalist, low-level implementation of the iconic arcade game, showcasing the power and efficiency of Assembly programming. The game runs in a terminal or a simple graphical environment, depending on the implementation.

🕹️ How to Play
Controls:

Use the left (A) and right (D) keys to move the paddle.

The goal is to keep the ball in play and break all the bricks.

Gameplay:

The ball bounces off the paddle, walls, and bricks.

Each brick broken earns you points.

If the ball falls below the paddle, you lose a life.

Complete all levels to win the game!

Features:

Simple graphics rendered in the terminal or a basic graphical display.

Score tracking and level progression.

Efficient and fast performance due to Assembly's low-level optimizations.

🛠️ Technical Details
Language: Assembly (x86 or ARM, depending on the target platform).

Environment:

Can be run in a terminal using ASCII graphics.

Alternatively, can use a simple graphics library or BIOS interrupts for rendering.

Input Handling: Keyboard input is captured using interrupts or system calls.

Rendering: The game screen is updated in real-time using character-based or pixel-based rendering.

🚀 How to Run
Assemble the Code:

Use an assembler like NASM (for x86) or ARM assembler (for ARM architectures).

Example for x86:

bash
Copy
nasm -f elf arknoid.asm -o arknoid.o
ld arknoid.o -o arknoid
Run the Game:

Execute the compiled binary:

bash
Copy
./arknoid
Platform-Specific Notes:

For terminal-based versions, ensure your terminal supports the necessary character rendering.

For graphical versions, ensure the required libraries or BIOS interrupts are available.
